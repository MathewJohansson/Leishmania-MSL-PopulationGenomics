# Population Genomics of Miltefosine Resistance in *Leishmania infantum*

## Overview

*Leishmania infantum* causes visceral leishmaniasis, affecting thousands globally. This project investigates the evolutionary dynamics of miltefosine resistance through population genomic analysis of the Miltefosine Sensitivity Locus (MSL) on chromosome 31.

**Central Research Question:** Is the spread of MSL deletions (conferring drug resistance) driven by positive selection or neutral demographic processes (e.g., drift)?

## Key Findings (Preliminary)

- Clear Old World/New World phylogenetic split.
- 13 distinct populations identified within *L. infantum* via ADMIXTURE.
- MSL deletions predominantly in Brazilian populations.
- Ploidy variation (diploid vs tetraploid) correlates with geography.

## Analytical Approach

### 1. Hierarchical Population Structure (ADMIXTURE)

ADMIXTURE analysis identified cryptic population structure across three complementary datasets:

- **All samples + outgroup (K=12):** Species-level structure separating *L. infantum* from *L. donovani*.
- **L. infantum only (K=13):** Fine-scale cryptic populations within *L. infantum*.
- **Americas only (K=13):** High-resolution New World structure where MSL deletions predominate.

Cross-validation error minimisation determined optimal K for each dataset.

#### Cross-Validation Error Justification (K=13)

*Figure 1: Cross-validation error minimisation confirms K=13 as optimal for L. infantum population structure. The lowest CV error at K=13 indicates this number of populations best explains the genetic structure within the species where MSL variation occurs.*

#### Population Assignments (K=13, L. infantum Only)

*Figure 2: ADMIXTURE-inferred population assignments (K=13) showing 13 distinct populations within L. infantum. Brazilian populations dominate the dataset, with clear geographic and genetic structure. This fine-scale resolution reveals cryptic subdivisions relevant to MSL resistance patterns.*

#### Ancestry Proportions (K=13)

### 2. Multi-Scale Phylogenetic Analysis

Comparing phylogenetic signal at three scales to detect selection on the MSL region:

- **Whole-genome phylogenies:** Neutral evolutionary baseline across all chromosomes.
- **100kb windows around MSL:** Regional selection signal on chromosome 31.
- **20kb windows around MSL:** Fine-scale locus-specific evolution.

Phylogenies stratified by ploidy level (diploid vs tetraploid strains) and annotated with geographic region, host species, and MSL copy number variation.

**Rationale:** If the MSL region is under selection, phylogenetic patterns on chromosome 31 will differ from genome-wide evolutionary history.

#### Whole-Genome Phylogeny (Neutral Baseline)

![Whole-Genome Phylogeny](readme_images/whole_genome_phylogeny_circular.jpeg)

*Figure 4: Circular maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree based on whole-genome SNPs (L. infantum only, n=463 samples). Tips are coloured by geographic region and annotated with host species (circles = human, triangles = dog) and MSL copy number (symbol size indicates ploidy). Clear Old World/New World split evident with strong bootstrap support.*

#### 100kb Window Around MSL (Regional Selection Signal)

![100kb Window Phylogeny](readme_images/100kb_window_phylogeny_circular.jpeg)

*Figure 5: Phylogenetic tree based on 100kb genomic window surrounding the MSL locus on chromosome 31. Comparison with whole-genome tree reveals topological differences in New World lineages, suggesting localized selection pressure on the MSL region in American populations where miltefosine resistance is prevalent.*

#### 20kb Window Around MSL (Fine-Scale Evolution)

![20kb Window Phylogeny](readme_images/20kb_window_phylogeny_circular.jpeg)

*Figure 6: High-resolution phylogeny from 20kb window directly flanking the MSL genes. Clustering patterns differ from genome-wide phylogeny, with MSL deletions (small symbols indicating low copy number) concentrated in specific Brazilian clades, providing evidence for selection acting on the MSL locus.*

### 3. Geographic Distribution Analysis ⏳

Spatial analysis of MSL copy number variation and population distribution across global sampling locations.

**Status:** Collaborative analysis complete, integration in progress.

---

### 4. Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium Testing ⏳

Tests whether MSL allele frequencies deviate from neutral expectations within populations, distinguishing selection from demographic history.

**Status:** Analysis complete, integration in progress.

---

## Clinical Relevance

MSL deletions confer resistance to **miltefosine**, the only oral treatment for leishmaniasis. Understanding whether resistant strains spread via:

- **Selection:** Faster than expected, requires urgent intervention.
- **Drift:** Random spread, reflects demographic history.

...has direct implications for treatment policy and surveillance strategies.
